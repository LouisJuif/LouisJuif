- 👋 Hi, I’m @LouisJuif
- 👀 I’m recently interested in the UX UI design, I dream of knowing how to make magnificent ergonomic interfaces, accessible to everyone !
- 🌱 I try to improve my knowledge in frontend development every day, by learning new frameworks like ReactJS or Vue.JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects to continuously improve myself on the technologies that I know or even learn new languages, technologies or frameworks that I don't yet know !
